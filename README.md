This is a website I made to collect and showcase my work and experience around robotics and computer engineering throughout my study in Highschool and University, It's the first website I've ever made using the help of Bootstrap front-end framework. Most of the css involved in this project was pre-made by Bootstrap, I hope that soon I'd be able to make a website all by myself.
